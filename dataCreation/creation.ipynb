Since this is time-series data, you should perform the split chronologically (e.g., use the first 80% of rows for training and the remaining 20% for testing).\n","2.  **Scale the features**: Use a scaler like `MinMaxScaler` from scikit-learn to scale all feature values to a range (e.g., 0 to 1). It's important to fit the scaler *only* on the training data and then transform both the training and testing data.\n","3.  **Reshape for LSTM**: LSTM layers in Keras/TensorFlow require input data in a 3D shape of `[samples, timesteps, features]`. You need to create sequences of data.
